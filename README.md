# Zoom Alert
Sketch.app plugin for showing a small notification near the bottom of the UI window, with the current document’s zoom percent. Useful when the toolbar is set to **Icon Only**, as it’s impossible to view the zoom level without **Icon and Text** or **Text Only** enabled.

## Installation
1. Download and open `Zoom-Alert-master.zip`
2. Navigate the Sketch menu bar to `Plugins ▸ Reveal Plugins Folder...`
3. Place `Zoom Alert.sketchplugin` into the revealed plugins directory
4. That’s it...
 
## How to Use
Select `Plugins ▸ Zoom Alert` in the Sketch menu bar or use the keyboard shortcut to show the document’s current zoom percent. The zoom alert will fade out after one second.    
 
**Keyboard Shortcut**  
`Control` + `z`
